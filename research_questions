A right-handed pitcher is curious about how velocity, movement, and spin rates on fastballs affect the chances of batters putting the ball in play. Attached are two CSV files. Both files contain 10,000 random pitches of fastballs thrown in the strike zone by right-handed pitchers to right-handed batters (swings and takes are both included). One of them (training.csv) also includes whether the batter was able to put the ball in play.

The columns are:
InPlay – A binary column indicating if the batter put the ball in play (1 = in play, 0 = not in play)
Velo – The velocity of the pitch at release (in mph)
SpinRate – The Spin Rate of the pitch at release (in rpm)
HorzBreak – The amount of movement the pitch had in the horizontal direction (in inches)
InducedVertBreak – The amount of movement (in inches) the pitch had in the vertical direction after accounting for the effects of gravity. A positive value means the pitch would move up in a gravity free environment that still had the same air resistance.

Please complete the following questions:

1. Predict the chance of a pitch being put in play. Please use this model to predict the chance of each pitch in the “deploy.csv” file being put in play and return a csv with your predictions. 

2. In one paragraph, please explain your process and reasoning for any decisions you made in Question 1.

3. In one or two sentences, please describe to the pitcher how these 4 variables affect the batter’s ability to put the ball in play. You can also include one plot or table to show to the pitcher if you think it would help.

4. In one or two sentences, please describe what you would see as the next steps with your model and/or results if you were in the analyst role and had another week to work on the question posed by the pitcher.

5. Please include any code (R, Python, or other) you used to answer the questions.  This code doesn’t need to be production quality or notated.
